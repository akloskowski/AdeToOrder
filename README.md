## Scientific Calculator

### Description. 
Presents to the user a fully functional scientific calculator that works 
the same way a regular one would. You click on the buttons in the same 
manner you would on a regular online version of the scientific calculator. 
Upon pressing ENTER, the calculator would return your final answer or an 
error message if there's something wrong with your input expression. 

### Launch Instructions
1. Clone the repository. 
2. Connect into the Calculator directory. 
3. Find the driver file. 
3. Press the play icon in the top left corner of the file. 
4. Start inputing expressions. 

### How the Code Works:
The input expression is translated into pieces of data where it is then 
sorted into a Binary Tree. The sorting is based on the Order of Operations
with the operations solved first at the leaves and working up to the 
roots. The final answer is stored in the root node where it is then presented
to the user.
